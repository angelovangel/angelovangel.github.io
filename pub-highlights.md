Background: Aliphatic hydrocarbons of microbial origin are highly interesting
candidate biofuels because these molecules are identical or very similar to the
main components of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. The high-GC
Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus is capable of naturally synthesizing
long-chain, iso- and anteiso-branched alkenes which are formed via the
head-to-head condensation of fatty acid thioesters by a dedicated enzyme system. 
The present study describes the relation we observed between olefin production
and cell buoyancy in Micrococcus luteus and the use of this phenotype to simply
and efficiently separate cells from a mixture based on their hydrocarbon content.
Methods: We generated M. luteus mutants producing different amounts of olefins
and used them in mixing and sedimentation experiments, olefin content analysis by
GC-MS and in equilibrium centrifugation in Percoll gradients.
Results: We found well-detectable differences in the buoyant densities of the
examined strains, which correlated with the amounts of hydrocarbons produced by
the cells. We also demonstrate how our observations can be used to simply and
efficiently fractionate cells based on their hydrocarbon content.
Conclusions: In summary, we show that cultures of M. luteus cells sediment at
distinct rates depending on the amounts of alkenes produced. Our results indicate
that buoyant cell density is the primary cause for the observed differences in
sedimentation behaviour. The simple separation strategy described here can be a
valuable tool in various mutagenesis and enrichment protocols, aimed at
generating and isolating strains with increased olefin productivity.</font>
