I am a postdoc in microbiology, working at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).   
If you are interested in my professional experience, skills and education, you can take a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](https://angelovangel.github.io/cv), or at the more compact [Résumé](https://angelovangel.github.io/resume). You may also want to check out this [fancy timevis with the scientific papers](https://angelovangel.github.io/pub-timevis) I have authored.   
This blog is intended to be a collection of posts about apps and guides I write (or sometimes just useful code junks), mostly related to the R programming language. Some of the apps are running on Amazon and can be tried out in a browser, [here](https://angelovangel.github.io/portfolio) is a list with links.
