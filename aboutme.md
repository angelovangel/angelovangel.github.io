I am a molecular biologist, working at the Next Generation Sequencing Competence Center Tübingen ([NCCT](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/medizinische-fakultaet/forschung/core-facilities/ncct)).   
If you are interested in my professional experience, skills and education, you can take a look at my [Résumé](https://angelovangel.github.io/resume).    
This blog is intended to be a collection of posts about apps and guides I write (or sometimes just useful code junks), mostly related to the R programming language. Some of the apps are running on Amazon and can be tried out in a browser, [here](https://angelovangel.github.io/portfolio) is a list with links.
