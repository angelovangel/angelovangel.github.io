# Interactive heatmap of your google location history 
[google-location-heatmap](https://github.com/angelovangel/google-location-heatmap) is my take on the problem of visualising your location history data from google.
This Shiny app takes your google location history, which you can download from your google account, and plots it as a heat trace on a map. You can interactively change some of the settings (map opacity, radius and blur of the heatmap) and select the time range you want to see.
