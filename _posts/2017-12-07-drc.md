The `drc` package by Christian Ritz does a very nice job in modelling dose-response biological data, which is often described by a sigmoid curve. 
The package provides various functions for the analysis of one or multiple non-linear curves and provides also
nice "self-start" functionality which makes model fitting much easier.
